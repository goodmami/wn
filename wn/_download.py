    First the URL of the resource is determined and then, depending on
    the parameters, the resource is downloaded and added to the
    database.  The function then returns the path of the cached file.

    If *project_or_url* starts with `'http://'` or `'https://'`, then
    it is taken to be the URL for the resource. Otherwise,
    *project_or_url* is taken as a :ref:`project specifier
    <lexicon-specifiers>` and the URL is taken from a matching entry
    in Wn's project index. If no project matches the specifier,
    :exc:`wn.Error` is raised.

    If the URL has been downloaded and cached before, the cached file
    is used. Otherwise the URL is retrieved and stored in the cache.

    If the *add* paramter is ``True`` (default), the downloaded
    resource is added to the database.

    created, used, and closed by this function.
