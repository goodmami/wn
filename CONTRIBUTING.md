## Report a Bug

When reporting a bug, please provide enough information for someone to
reproduce the problem. This might include the version of Python you're
running, the version of Wn you have installed, the wordnet lexicons
you have installed, and possibly the platform (Linux, Windows, macOS)
you're on. Please give a minimal working example that illustrates the
problem. For example:

> I'm using Wn 0.7.0 with Python 3.8 on Linux and [description of
> problem...]. Here's what I have tried:
>
> ```pycon
> >>> import wn
> >>> # some code
> ... # some result or error
> ```


## Request a Feature

If there's a feature that you think would make a good addition to Wn,
raise an issue describing what the feature is and what problems it
would address.

## Guidelines for Contributing

See the "developer information" above for a brief description of
guidelines and conventions used in Wn. If you have a fix, please
submit a pull request to the `main` branch. In general, every pull
request should have an associated issue.

Developers should install Wn locally from source using
[Flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Flit may be installed
system-wide or within a virtual environment:

```bash
$ pip install flit
$ flit install -s
```

The `-s` option tells Flit to use symbolic links to install Wn,
similar to pip's -e editable installs. This allows one to edit source
files and use the changes without having to reinstall Wn each time.
